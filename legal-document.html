                <div class="text-gray-300 space-y-4">
                    <p><strong>Credit Score Assessment:</strong> LightStream Financial Services utilizes comprehensive credit evaluation methodologies, including but not limited to FICO scores, credit history analysis, debt-to-income ratios, and payment history.

                    <p><strong>Identity and Income Verification:</strong> All applicants must provide valid government-issued identification, proof of income, and employment verification. The Company reserves the right to request additional documentation to verify identity, income sources, and financial capacity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Banking Verification Requirements:</strong> Applicants must maintain an active bank account in good standing. The Company conducts verification procedures to confirm account ownership, balance history, and transaction patterns. Accounts with negative balances, restrictions, or fraudulent activity may result in application denial.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Guarantee of Approval:</strong> Submission of an application does not guarantee loan approval. All applications are subject to final underwriting review, and the Company maintains the right to decline any application for any lawful reason.</p>

                <div class="text-gray-300 space-y-4">
                    <p><strong>Circumstances Under Which PPI is Required:</strong> Based on risk assessment, credit profile, loan amount, and regulatory compliance requirements, certain applicants may be required to maintain Payment Protection Insurance as a condition of loan approval. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis during underwriting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk-Based Insurance Requirement:</strong> PPI requirements are determined through sophisticated risk modeling algorithms that consider multiple factors including credit score, loan-to-value ratios, employment stability, and industry best practices. Higher-risk profiles may necessitate insurance coverage to mitigate default risk.</p>
                    <p><strong>PPI Cost Range:</strong> Payment Protection Insurance premiums typically range from $500 to $900, depending on loan amount, coverage level, term duration, and individual risk factors. Premium amounts are clearly disclosed in the loan agreement and may be financed as part of the loan or paid separately.</p>

All required costs are structured within the loan framework or facilitated through alternative means.</p>
                    <p><strong>Compliance Facilitation:</strong> The Company has established procedures to ensure regulatory compliance without imposing direct financial burdens on customers. This includes verification credit mechanisms, structured financing options, and compliance cost absorption where permissible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Description of Verification Credits:</strong> Temporary, restricted credits may be issued to applicant bank accounts to normalize balances for verification purposes. These credits are specifically designed to facilitate compliance with banking regulations and verification requirements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose of Issuance:</strong> Verification credits are issued solely to establish proper account standing, enable verification procedures, and ensure compliance with anti-fraud and anti-money laundering regulations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Return Requirement:</strong> Applicants must return equivalent funds within the specified timeframe to complete the verification process. This return is mandatory for application processing and serves as documentation and recordkeeping evidence.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fund Classification:</strong> Verification credits are explicitly classified as:

                    <p><strong>Prohibition Policy:</strong> LightStream Financial Services strictly prohibits loan disbursement into bank accounts with negative balances, restrictions, freezes, or other limitations that would impede proper fund access or repayment processing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Normalization Process:</strong> When verification reveals account balance issues, the Company may issue verification credits to normalize account standing. This process is designed to bring accounts to zero or positive balance status to facilitate proper loan processing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Balance Return Requirement:</strong> Any remaining verification credit balance after normalization must be returned to the Company within the specified timeframe. Failure to return funds may result in application denial or other remedial actions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Final Disbursement Conditions:</strong> Loan proceeds will only be disbursed to accounts that meet all verification criteria, including positive balance status, absence of restrictions, and successful completion of all compliance procedures.</p>
